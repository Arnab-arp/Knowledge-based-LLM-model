How SaaS work? 
SaaSâ€¯operates on a cloud-based model where software applications are hosted by a service provider and accessed over the internet. Instead of purchasing and installing software on local computers or servers, customers subscribe to the software and use it online. This approach offers several advantages, including ease of access, scalability, and reduced IT infrastructure needs. When a customer subscribes to a SaaS application, they typically log in through a web browser. The application runs on the service provider's servers, which handle all the processing and data storage. This allows customers to access the software from any device with an internet connection, providing flexibility and mobility. The service provider manages software maintenance, including updates, security, and backups, so customers always have the latest features and security patches. From a technical perspective, SaaS providers use multitenant architecture, meaning a single instance of the software serves multiple customers. This approach optimizes resources and reduces costs, as infrastructure and maintenance expenses are distributed across many customers. SaaS applications are also highly scalable, allowing customers to easily adjust their subscription levels based on their needs, whether that means adding features, increasing storage, or supporting more users. Overall, SaaS simplifies software management for customers, providing a cost-effective and convenient way to access powerful applications without the complexities of traditional software deployment.
