When to use GraphQL?
The runtime can handle so many parts that I would otherwise have to deal with manually like types and validation of schemas, being able to easily fetch from the client and generate types with codegen is a much better experience IMO than OpenAPI, and the dev experience with GQLGen is really good. If you want to work with an ORM I can recommend checking out Ent which has a GQLGen integration and can automatically build Relay connection types and handle other use-cases for you. 
Here are the main reasons:
* excellent data modeling
* get required data in single api call
* great tooling(super easy to generate client sdk)
* self documentations
