What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that gives API clients exactly the data they requested. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL allows developers to make requests to fetch data from multiple data sources with a single API call. GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or discard fields without affecting existing queries. Developers can build APIs the way they want, and the GraphQL specification ensures that APIs behave predictably for clients. GraphQL can also be deployed to an integrated development environment (IDE) called GraphiQL.
