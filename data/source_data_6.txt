Why SaaS teams and products use GraphQL APIs?
GraphQL is one of the more recent API types for integrations. It was built specifically to restrict the amount of data returned to exactly what was requested (no under-fetching, no over-fetching) as well as to make it easier to return data for different but related objects all at once, thereby reducing the number of times we have to "go to the well" to get data. As a result, GraphQL is probably the most efficient API type for queries.
GraphQL APIs can be particularly attractive to devs because GraphQL, like SQL, includes a language for requests but at the same time describes the structure of the data being returned. GraphQL APIs are built on the concept of data as a graph that can be queried. Once you have defined the schema for a GraphQL API, you can crawl or spider through the graph to get everything needed.
